# ODFD-PROJECT
This repository contains collaborative inputs for an innnovative web application that redesigns the on-demand food delivery (ODFD) service.

The proposed platform aims to attract customers to local businesses and small kaibars, generating wealth
down to the grassroots

# What is this platform?
It is an online platform where food & beverage servings are displayed by various sellers from restaurants, hotels, food stalls or bars. The platform provides a central avenue where sellers can display their dining menu to potential diners and is analogous to a physical marketplace but digital in nature. With that analogy, the platform provides unrivalled insights into the food industry marketplace with information on competitor services, customer and nutritional insights.

Dinners benefit immensely as the platform allows for them to access instantly available servings at various restaurants, hotels, food stalls or bars depending on personal preferences. It allows the diner to make an informed decision about where to dine, what to eat and how much it’ll cost before even setting out from their point of origin to destination for an eat out with friends’ family or at a business meeting. It also provides the opportunity to critique or provide feedback on the servings using a 5-star rating scheme along with pictures and commentary. Other diners visiting the platform will then be able to read or view what others have experienced on their servings.

The platform also offers unique benefits to the seller as it allows them to advertise their meal servings on a dedicated platform targeting food enthusiasts, critiques, tourists and essentially anyone that is curious about food & beverage in general. Sellers gain market awareness about competitor servings and trends on customer feedback or preferences from the portal to develop an amazing dining experience be it a recipe invention, a twist to regular servings to elevate its taste or in its customer service. These insights will be powered by Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

# How is it intended to work?

The platform is envisioned to function as a web application for users intending to sign up and sell their servings (refered to as seller) and also as a mobile application for users wanting to explore available servings (refered to as consumers). To access the application, both sellers and consumers will require access credentials for which the user interface (UI) is specific.

#### *Seller*
Upon signing up for the seller, the UI will be intuitive allowing the seller to easily load images and type out serving descriptions. They will also be provided with the option to access paid addon features such as promoting their servings for a certain amount of days or advertise their business. The seller can also have the option for AR Navigation which will allow consumers to interactively navigate to their location or have the option for a 360 photo viewer of the location. There will also be the addon feature to gain market awareness about similar competitors through natural language processing (NLP) from consumer comments on servings and recieve notifications about consumer ratings or reviews on their servings.

The seller end will require subscription fees which will be monthly or yearly plans.

#### *Consumer*
The consumer end will gain access to the platform via mobile application either as iOS or android. The UI for the consumer will be simple and intuitive where  sections will be separated clearly by bold headings to direct attention. Upon viewing servings, the consumer can either write a review (either positive, negative or neutral) or give a rating out of 5 stars. They will also be able to see the rating of other servings as well as the rating of sellers as a measure of consumer quality and satisfaction.

Importantly, the consumer end is free and requires no subscription.
